# Backed NFT Docs
The Backed community gives out NFTs to recognize community members and contributors. You can [see past versions on OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/nft-pawn-shop-community-nfts). In June 2022, a new Community NFT was created that tracks XP across three categories: Activity, Contributor, and Community, and awards them both automatically (via bots) and through a nomination process. This rubric outlines eligibility for XP rewards: 

<div id="automatically-awarded-xp">

### Automatically Awarded XP
These actions are tracked and logged by bots, reviewed by humans weekly, and the XP automatically appear on your Community NFT. 

#### Activity XP
- As a lender, provide your first loan
- As a borrower, pay interest on your first loan

#### Contributor XP
- Author a pull request that is merged (start in #dev on Discord)

#### Community XP
- Attend your first community call, Mondays at 11AM EST
- Addional XP with exponential decay: 2nd call, 4th call, 8th, 16th, etc.

### XP Awarded via Nomination Form
Some XP require a nomination process, to limit bots or scams. Once you complete a task or do something noteworthy, nominate yourself (or others!) for XP using the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5jfpa7okOGHU6WgIhqCtg_ImndrivZtVq3-Vk5OBmhCeY-Q/viewform).

#### Activity XP Examples
Nominate yourself for XP for remarkable protocol usage for which there is no automated tracking, such as:
- First ever loan
- Loan with most buyouts

#### Contributor XP
Nominate yourself for XP that help develop the protocol, such as:
- Early-release testing and testnet transactions
- Code reviews on Github
- Design assets used in production
- Smart contract auditing

#### Community XP
Nominate yourself for XP that add your voice to the community, such as:
- Organize a meetup at a conference
- Quality memes

### Accessories
Accessories are an art layer added to the bunny, typically in the form of neckwear. They can be earned automatically by reaching certain XP counts, or be awarded via the [nomination form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd5jfpa7okOGHU6WgIhqCtg_ImndrivZtVq3-Vk5OBmhCeY-Q/viewform) for special activies or roles.

#### XP-Based Accessories
- **Gold Chain Contributor** awarded when _1st Contributor XP_ is earned
- **Purple Community Scarf** awarded when _1st Community XP_ is earned
- **Pink Protocol Lei** awarded when _1st Activity XP_ is earned

When _4th XP in any category_ is earned (and display switches from individual XP stars to the counter) the user is awarded an “super” version of the relevant trait, called:
- **Super Chain Contributor**
- **Super Community Scarf**
- **Super Protocol Lei**

#### Role-Based Accessories
- **Alpha Snake** is awarded to original community NFT holders, based on a [7/6/2022 snapshot](https://gist.github.com/wilsoncusack/4e65c36abd1ae623f6375ed7aafbfcac)
